- [x] Setup compilation of the same program with different toolchain to simulate several platform
- [x] Build with bash script on OS X
- [x] Build with ninja on OS X
- [x] Build with gn on OS X
- [x] Build with ninja on Windows
- [x] Build with gn on Windows
- [x] Build static lib on Windows
- [x] Make toolchain include_dir and lib_path being defined in a default config instead of hardcoded
- [x] Improve the way we build for multiple platform at the same time
- [x] Tool and runtime target should not be outputed on the same folder
- [x] Make possible to specifiy Visual Studio version and WinSDK version
- [x] Is it possible to do "${variable_${sub_var_name}}"? No
- [x] Enable debug info on Windows
- [x] Generate Visual Studio solution on Windows
- [x] Make possible to compile only 1 target, only buildtool, only tool, only runtime target for specific platform
- [x] Build a C++ tool which is used to generate .cpp file used in the build
- [x] Integrate the code generator describe above with
- [ ] Make C++ executable being able to depend on rpc generated code
- [ ] Build tool which simulate different asset generation for different platform
- [ ] Integrate the asset build tool above, and make sure about data dependencies
- [ ] specify the path to ninja when generating visual studio project
- [ ] Integrate with test
- [ ] Research C# integration
- [ ] Research Visual Studio integration
- [ ] Integrate rpc_generator with C#
- [ ] Research Incredibuild integration with ninja
- [ ] Build with fastbuild on OS X
- [ ] DEMO: show you can change build flag and recompile (for instance tool debug, runtime release)
- [ ] DEMO: preset with default Debug, Optimized, Release config
- [ ] DEMO: show we can multiple build folder for multiple build configuration at the same time
- [ ] DEMO: Show incremental build which works for assets and generated files
